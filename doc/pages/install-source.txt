Build Dependencies
==================

Go
--
Install Go 1.1 or newer from `golang.org <http://golang.org/doc/install>`_.

On Ubuntu, the Juju PPA maintains packages for recent versions of Go,
recommended for building Hockeypuck::

  $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:juju/golang
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install golang-go

Set up your `Go language environment variables <http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH>`_.

DVCS Clients
------------
Go will need these DVCS clients installed in order to provision the source code to Hockeypuck's package dependencies:

* Bazaar
* Mercurial
* Git

On Ubuntu::

  $ sudo apt-get install bzr mercurial git

Build
=====

Check out the Hockeypuck sources, with all its package dependencies into your
Go development workspace with::

  $ go get launchpad.net/hockeypuck/...


Then compile binaries with::

  $ go install launchpad.net/hockeypuck/...

Install
=======

Binaries
--------
Hockeypuck should have been compiled to $GOPATH/bin/hockeypuck in the above step. Hockeypuck can be run from this location.

Media
-----
Hockeypuck will need to access the static media files (Go HTML templates, images, CSS, JS and fonts). These files will have been checked out into $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/hockeypuck/instroot/var/lib/hockeypuck/www in the above steps. If Hockeypuck is run with the same $GOPATH environment variable set, it will be able to automatically locate these files when running the service.

Otherwise, you will need to set the hockeypuck.hkp.webroot configuration setting to the installed location of these files.

Next Steps
==========

Now you have compiled static Hockeypuck binaries in $GOPATH/bin, you're ready to run. Move on to
`Configuration </configuration.html>`_ to set up your Hockeypuck service.
