Front-page Graphic
==================
The "gopher bringing the keys" graphic on the `front page </index.html>`_
is of course a basic remix of `Go Language Gopher mascot <http://golang.org/doc/faq#Whats_the_origin_of_the_mascot>`_. The keys were from an open-source SVG I found. When I find the source, I'll add it here.

go.crypto/openpgp
=================
I made several improvements to the Go language implementation of OpenPGP
in `go.crypto <https://code.google.com/p/go.crypto>`_ to support Hockeypuck needs,
mostly with regards to OpenPGP parsing. The review process improved my Go
programming habits and was generally quick and easy. Go is an enjoyable project to
contribute to! Also, Rietveld is awesome.

sks-devel
=========
sks-devel has offered great advice on Hockeypuck, and helped me understand
the SKS reconciliation algorithms and other implementation details.

Third-party Libraries
=====================
Hockeypuck would not be where it is without the Go language standard library
and other packages it is built on. See debian/copyright for a complete up-to-date
listing.
