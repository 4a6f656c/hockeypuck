Launchpad
=========
The `Hockeypuck <https://launchpad.net/hockeypuck>`_ project is hosted in Launchpad.

Post feature ideas, defects and questions to the `Launchpad project bug tracker <https://bugs.launchpad.net/hockeypuck>`_.

Source Code
-----------
Leading edge development happens in the trunk branch, `lp:hockeypuck <https://code.launchpad.net/~hockeypuck/hockeypuck/trunk>`_. Keeping a stable trunk (building & passing unit tests) is priority.

To contribute a patch, push to a local branch with your changes, for example::

  $ bzr push lp:~user/hockeypuck/my-contribution

Then create a request to merge the branch to lp:hockeypuck (or release target branch). This is similar to a pull request in Github.

Hockeypuck trunk is `mirrored in Github <https://github.com/cmars/hockeypuck>`_ mostly for backup purposes, and may lag the Launchpad trunk. I may not be able to directly merge pull requests through Github. Collaboration through Launchpad is certainly preferred.

Mailing List
------------

Discuss the project on the `hockeypuck-dev mailing list <https://lists.launchpad.net/hockeypuck-dev/>`_. You'll need to join the open `hockeypuck-dev team <https://launchpad.net/~hockeypuck-dev>`_ in Launchpad in order to register your email address.
