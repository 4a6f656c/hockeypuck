`Hockeypuck <https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck>`_ project development has moved to Github. Issues and pull requests welcome!

Launchpad (older archive)

Earlier development was hosted on the `Launchpad project site <https://launchpad.net/hockeypuck>`_. Launchpad is still used for hosting cross-compiled binary tarball releases and Ubuntu packages in the PPA.
