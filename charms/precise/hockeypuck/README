# Overview

SKS is a synchronizing public key server, which functions as a directory service
for OpenPGP keys. This charm can be used to deploy a standalone server or a
peering cluster of SKS instances.

# Installation

To deploy this charm you will need at a minimum: a cloud environment, working
Juju installation and a successful bootstrap. Once bootstrapped, deploy this
SKS charm with:

 $ juju deploy hockeypuck

Hockeypuck requires a PostgreSQL database:

 $ juju deploy postgresql
 $ juju add-relation hockeypuck postgresql:db

Hockeypuck can gossip with other Hockeypuck peers:

 $ juju add-unit hockeypuck
 $ juju add-relation hockeypuck/0 hockeypuck/1

Or with SKS:

 $ juju deploy sks
 $ juju add-relation hockeypuck sks

Expose the Hockeypuck keyserver with:

juju expose hockeypuck
