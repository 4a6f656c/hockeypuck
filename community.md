Github
======
`Hockeypuck <https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck>`_ project development has moved to Github. Issues and pull requests welcome!

Mailing List
============
I've created `hockeypuck-devel <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hockeypuck-devel>`_ for community discussion of Hockeypuck development and direction of the project. Announcements will be posted there.

Launchpad (older archive)
-------------------------
Earlier development was hosted on the `Launchpad project site <https://launchpad.net/hockeypuck>`_. Launchpad still contained 1.x cross-compiled binary tarball releases and PPA packages for Ubuntu.
