# Community

## Github

See [contributing](contributing.md) for a guide to all the Github projects that
comprise the Hockeypuck product.

### Issues

If you're having a problem with the Hockeypuck server, you should open an issue
on https://github.com/hockeypuck/server. For historical reasons, there are also
issues open on https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck, because that used to
be the entire codebase of the product.

Open an issue on the other projects if your issue pertains specifically to its
isolated use. For example, if you use
[conflux](https://github.com/hockeypuck/conflux) in some other application, you
should definitely open a bug there.

## Mailing List
Use
[hockeypuck-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hockeypuck-devel)
for community discussion of Hockeypuck development and direction of the
project. Announcements will be posted there.
