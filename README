Hockeypuck: OpenPGP Key Server

Hockeypuck is being developed with design goals of performance, flexibility,
reliability and portability.

Performance: We want Hockeypuck to be able to handle heavy concurrent loads of
key submissions and search requests, with reasonable response times.

Flexibility: Alternative storage backends should be easy to integrate into the
server if necessary. The server should also support custom extensions to HKP,
to support development of new web-of-trust OpenPGP applications.

Reliability: The keyserver should be configurable to run in a resilient and
highly-available manner.

Portability: The keyserver should run on a reasonably wide variety of server
operating systems and architectures with minimal hassle and minimal dependencies.
