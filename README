Hockeypuck: OpenPGP Key Server
==============================

Hockeypuck is being developed with design goals of performance, flexibility,
reliability and portability.

Performance: We want Hockeypuck to be able to handle heavy concurrent loads of
key submissions and search requests, with reasonable response times.

Flexibility: Alternative storage backends should be easy to integrate into the
server if necessary. The server should also support custom extensions to HKP,
to support development of new web-of-trust OpenPGP applications.

Reliability: The keyserver should be configurable to run in a resilient and
highly-available manner.

Portability: The keyserver should run on a reasonably wide variety of server
operating systems and architectures with minimal hassle and minimal dependencies.

Installing on Ubuntu
====================

Add the Hockeypuck PPA to your package sources with:

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:hockeypuck/unstable (pre-1.0 final release)
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install hockeypuck

Installing from Binaries
========================

Hockeypuck is cross-compiled for most Unix-based OSes and architectures that the
Go language tools can target, available from: https://launchpad.net/hockeypuck/+download

The tarball is structured to extract into /.

I've seen Hockeypuck run on darwin, freebsd and netbsd. I regularly develop and deploy
to linux/amd64 and occasionally on linux/arm (Chromebook).

Installing from Source
======================

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need to install bzr, git and mercurial. This is necessary so that
'go get' can provision all of Hockeypuck's source dependencies,

Hockeypuck requires Go 1.1 or newer to build. On Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:juju/golang  # Juju's golang PPA is more recent
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install -y bzr mercurial git

Install the Hockeypuck keyserver to $GOPATH/bin

$ go get launchpad.net/hockeypuck/cmd/hockeypuck
$ go install launchpad.net/hockeypuck/cmd/hockeypuck
