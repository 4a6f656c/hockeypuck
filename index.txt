Features
========

Standards and Specifications
----------------------------
Hockeypuck implements the
`HKP draft protocol specification <http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-shaw-openpgp-hkp/>`_
as well as several extensions to the protocol supported by `SKS <http://sks-keyservers.net/>`_.

Hockeypuck stores OpenPGP public key material conforming to `RFC 4880 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880>`_ as well as ECC keys conforming to `RFC 6637 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6637>`_.

PostgreSQL Key Database
-----------------------
Hockeypuck stores all public key material in a relational database.
The schema is optimized for performance but also data integrity, cross-referencing
and search capabilities with judicious use of foreign keys and full-text indexing.

SKS Reconciliation Protocol
---------------------------
Hockeypuck is the first keyserver besides SKS capable of gossiping with other
SKS (and Hockeypuck) peers to synchronize public key material. Recon
support is provided with the `Conflux <https://github.com/cmars/conflux>`_ library,
developed initially for this purpose.
